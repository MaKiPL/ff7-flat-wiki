## File Format

There are pairs of two files. First one are field model textures. The second one are model, sprites data, as well as text and script.

## First file - Textures and CLUT

## Second file - Field Data

This is uniq pack of different data. There are always 8 files in there. All of them are compressed. The most part of header are unknown, except few data.

There are files:

- 1\) unknown
- 2\) walkmeshes
- 3\) pack of 3d models
- 4\) sprites
- 5\) sprites animation
- 6\) entitys and scripts
- 7\) unknown
- 8\) text

**2) walkmeshes**

Contains number of walkmeshes for character and camera.

| Start offset | Size | Value |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0x00 | 0x04 bytes | Number of walkmeshes |
| 0x04 + Number of walkmesh \* 0x04 | 0x04 bytes | Length of walkmesh |
| 0x04 + (Number of walkmeshes + 1) \* 0x04 | 0x04 bytes | End of file |
| 0x04 + (Number of walkmeshes + 1) \* 0x04 + Number of walkmesh \* 0x08 | 0x04 bytes | Start of walkmesh triangle description |
| 0x04 + (Number of walkmeshes + 1) \* 0x04 + Number of walkmesh \* 0x08 + 0x04 | 0x04 bytes | Start of walkmesh vertexes |
|  |  |  |

Vertex array are simple.

| Start offset |    Size    |          Value          |
|:------------:|:----------:|:-----------------------:|

|     0x06     | 0x02 bytes | Aligment zeros (0x0000) |

Each triangle descript like this
