---

- Opcode: **0x92**
- Short name: **OR2**
- Long name: Bitwise OR (16-bit)

#### Memory layout

| 0x92 | *D/S* | *Dest* | *Oper* |
|------|-------|--------|--------|

#### Arguments

- **const Bit\[4\]** *D*: Destination bank.
- **const Bit\[4\]** *S*: Source bank, or zero if *Oper* is specified as a literal value.
- **const UByte** *Dest*: Address containing an operand of the bitwise OR, and that which receives the result.
- **const UShort** *Oper*: 16-bit operand of the bitwise OR, or address of the second operand, if *S* is non-zero.

#### Description

Performs a bitwise OR operation between *Dest* and *Oper* and stores the result back into *Dest*. If the Source Bank is 0 then *Oper* is the operand to OR with. If the Source Bank is a 16-bit bank, then the *Oper* is the address in that bank where the operand is.
