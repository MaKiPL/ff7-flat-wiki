| 0x91 | *D/S* | *Dest* | *Oper* |
|------|-------|--------|--------|

#### Arguments

- **const Bit\[4\]** *D*: Destination bank
- **const Bit\[4\]** *S*: Source bank
- **const UByte** *Dest*: Contains an operand of the bitwise OR and receives the result.
- **const UByte** *Oper*: The second operand of the bitwise OR.

#### Description

Performs a bitwise OR operation between "Dest" and "Oper" and stores the result back into "Dest". If the Source Bank is 0 then the â€œOperâ€ is the operand to OR with. If the Source Bank is an 8 bit bank, then the â€œOperâ€ is the address in that bank where the operand is.
