title: 90_AND2
---

- Opcode: **0x90**
- Short name: **AND2**
- Long name: Bitwise AND (16-bit)

#### Memory layout

| 0x90 | *D/S* | *Dest* | *Oper* |
|------|-------|--------|--------|

#### Arguments

- **const Bit\[4\]** *D*: Destination bank.
- **const Bit\[4\]** *S*: Source bank, or zero if *Oper* is specified as a literal value.
- **const UByte** *Dest*: Address containing an operand of the bitwise AND, and that which receives the result.
- **const UShort** *Oper*: 16-bit operand of the bitwise AND, or address of the second operand, if S is non-zero.

#### Description

Performs a bitwise AND operation between *Dest* and *Oper* and stores the result back into *Dest*. If the Source Bank is 0 then the *Oper* is the operand to AND with. If the Source Bank is a 16-bit bank, then the *Oper* is the address in that bank where the operand is.
