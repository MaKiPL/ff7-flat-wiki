- Opcode: **0x312**
- Name: set light coordinates in mesh
- Two-word opcode: No

#### Parameters

| Location | Name |     Description      |
|:--------:|:----:|:--------------------:|
|  Stack   |  X   | X coordinate in mesh |
|  Stack   |  Z   | Z coordinate in mesh |

#### Notes

Sets the active point's coordinates within its mesh, X and Z are numbers between 0 and 8191 (the size of one mesh).

World coordinates can be calculated as mesh coordinates \<\< 13 + coordinates in mesh or mesh coordinates \<\< 13 \| coordinates in mesh (coordinates in mesh can be thought of as the lower 13 bits while mesh coordinates are the upper bits).
