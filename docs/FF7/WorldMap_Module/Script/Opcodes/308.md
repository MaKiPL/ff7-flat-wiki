- Opcode: **0x308**
- Name: set active entity mesh coordinates
- Two-word opcode: No

#### Parameters

| Location | Name |    Description    |
|:--------:|:----:|:-----------------:|
|  Stack   |  X   | Mesh X coordinate |
|  Stack   |  Z   | Mesh Z coordinate |

#### Notes

Sets the active entity's mesh coordinates, X is a number between 0 and 35 (for 9 MAP blocks with 4 meshes each) while Z is a number between 0 and 27 (for 7 MAP blocks with 4 meshes each).

World coordinates can be calculated as mesh coordinates \<\< 13 + coordinates in mesh or mesh coordinates \<\< 13 \| coordinates in mesh (coordinates in mesh can be thought of as the lower 13 bits while mesh coordinates are the upper bits).
